# Claude Code Instructions - genro-orm

**Parent Document**: This project follows all policies from the central [genro-next-generation CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/genropy/genro-next-generation/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)

Read the parent document first for:
- Language policy (English only)
- Git commit authorship rules (no Claude co-author)
- Development status lifecycle (Pre-Alpha → Alpha → Beta)
- Temporary files policy (use temp/ directories)
- Standardization requirements
- All general project policies

## Project-Specific Context

### Current Status
- **Development Status**: Pre-Alpha
- **Has Implementation Code**: No
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/genropy/genro-orm

### Project Purpose

ORM layer for the Genropy framework. This project is in the design and planning phase - used for collecting requirements, discussing architecture, and creating issues.

### Key Decisions Pending

- Async support strategy
- Database backend selection
- Migration system approach
- Query builder API design

### Important

**DO NOT add implementation code without discussion**. This is a Pre-Alpha project for gathering requirements and architectural decisions through GitHub issues.

When implementation begins, update:
1. Development Status classifier in pyproject.toml to "3 - Alpha"
2. README.md status section
3. This CLAUDE.md file
